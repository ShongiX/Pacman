# Pacman Implementation with OpenGL

This repository showcases a Pacman game implemented using OpenGL for a university Computer Graphics subject. The project focuses on fundamental graphics programming concepts.

## Key Concepts

- **Shaders**: Utilizes vertex and fragment shaders for rendering graphics.
- **Controller**: Implements a controller class to handle user input.
- **Model**: Incorporates various entity classes, including dynamic entities and distinct Pacman ghosts (Blinky, Clyde, Inky, Pinky).
- **Pacman**: Features a Pacman class representing the main player character.
- **Game**: Implements a Game class managing the game state and logic.
- **View**: Includes shader functions, an image loading library, and UI widget classes for the game interface.

## Project Purpose

This Pacman implementation serves as a practical application of computer graphics concepts. It demonstrates OpenGL usage, shader implementation, and game development principles.
